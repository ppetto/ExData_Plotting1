### Explanation

This is **Peter Petto's** work in response to the Coursera Exploratory Data Analysis Project Assignment #1.

You will find PNG files for each of the four plots:

- plot1.png
- plot2.png
- plot3.png
- plot4.png

You will also find the R code that constructs each of the four plots:

- plot1.R
- plot2.R
- plot3.R
- plot4.R

Before *any* of the plotting code will work, the following file must be run:

- power_data_setup.R

It reads the data from the "household_power_consumption.txt" file that was provided. It must be present (unzipped) in the working directory alongside the five code files.
